## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned the importance of adding an alt attribute to images, as it improves accessibility by allowing screen readers to describe images to visually impaired users.

```html
<img src="./assets/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR Code linking to frontendmentor.io" class="qr-code">
```

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about using rem and % units to create responsive elements. Understanding how to effectively implement these units will help improve the adaptability of my designs across different screen sizes.

### Useful resources

- [A guide to flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This resource helped me keep track of which flex properties to use effectively.
